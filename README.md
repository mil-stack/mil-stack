Hi 👋 My name is Milana
"I am a testing engineer."
I am currently studying on the Hekselet platform and have successfully completed a project testing an online store. 
As part of my training, I have completed a series of courses that cover key aspects of software testing, including:

- Development of Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Basics of CRUD operations
- Positive and negative testing scenarios
- Creation of test cases and checklists
- Preparation of bug reports
- Regression testing
- Non-functional testing
- Time to Market
- Fundamentals of Agile, Scrum, and Kanban
- Using Grep for data analysis
- Basics of working with pipelines and the Sudo team

These courses have provided me with a solid foundation in testing and development, as well as helped me enhance my analytical skills and attention to detail. 
I am eager to apply my knowledge in practice and contribute to the success of your team.
